# Qash

**Qash** is a privacy‑first, programmable payment platform built on Miden, a blockchain that supports privacy by default by executing transactions locally and storing account data locally.

It enables custom payment logic (like cancellable, time‑lock, recurring, streaming and more) and private multisig management designed for teams, with AI integration for usability and personalization.

Qash is currently live on the Miden testnet. Try it here: [qash.finance](https://qash.finance)
