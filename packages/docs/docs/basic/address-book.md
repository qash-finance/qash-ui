# Address Book

The address book feature in Q3x organizes your Starknet contacts into folders, making it easy to manage and categorize
your frequently used addresses. Instead of dealing with long hexadecimal strings, you can organize contacts by groups
and use memorable names for quick access.

## How It Works

The address book uses a **folder system** where each folder represents a category of contacts. This helps you organize
addresses by purpose, such as:

- Family members
- Business partners
- Service providers
- Personal contacts

## Managing Your Address Book

### Creating New Contact Groups

1. **Add a New Folder**

   - Look for the "New Group" folder at the bottom of your screen
   - Click on the folder icon to open the creation form
   - Enter a category name (e.g., "Family", "Work", "Services")
   - Click the plus icon to add your first contact

2. **Add Contacts to a Group**
   - Click on any folder to open it
   - Click the "New Address" button that appears
   - Fill in the contact details:
     - **Name**: A memorable name for the contact
     - **Address**: The Starknet address
     - **Token**: Optional token preference
     - **Category**: Automatically set to the folder name
   - Click "Save" to add the contact

### Using Existing Folders

1. **Open a Folder**

   - Click on any folder icon at the bottom of the screen
   - The folder will open, revealing all contacts in that category
   - You'll see a list of address cards and a "New Address" button

2. **View Contact Details**
   - Each contact is displayed as a card showing the name and address
   - Click on a contact card to see more details or edit information

### Organizing Your Contacts

- **Automatic Categorization**: Contacts are automatically organized by the folder you create them in
- **Easy Navigation**: Switch between folders by clicking on different folder icons
- **Visual Organization**: Each folder has a unique appearance and shows how many contacts it contains

## Managing Individual Contacts

### Editing Contacts

1. **Modify Existing Contact**
   - Open the folder containing the contact
   - Click on the contact you wish to edit
   - Modify the name, address, or other details
   - Save your changes

### Removing Contacts

1. **Delete a Contact**
   - Open the folder containing the contact
   - Click the delete icon next to the contact
   - Confirm the deletion in the prompt
   - The contact will be removed from that folder

## Folder Management

### Creating New Categories

- Use the "New Group" folder to create custom categories
- Give each category a descriptive name (max 20 characters)
- Organize contacts logically for easy access

### Switching Between Folders

- Only one folder can be open at a time
- Click on a different folder to switch views
- The currently open folder will be highlighted
- All other folders automatically close when you open a new one

## Using Your Address Book

The organized folder system makes it easy to:

- **Quick Access**: Find contacts quickly by category
- **Logical Organization**: Group related contacts together
- **Efficient Management**: Add, edit, and remove contacts within organized folders
- **Better Workflow**: Navigate between different types of contacts seamlessly

## Integration with Other Features

Your organized address book works with other Q3x features:

- **Quick Selection**: Choose from categorized contacts when sending transactions
- **Recurring Payments**: Set up automated payments to contacts in specific folders
- **AI Assistant**: Use saved contacts when asking the AI for help with transactions

## Important Notes

- **Unique Names**: Contact names must be unique within each folder
- **Address Validation**: The system automatically validates all Starknet addresses
- **Category Limits**: Category names are limited to 20 characters
- **Automatic Organization**: Contacts are automatically sorted by creation date within each folder
- **Folder Persistence**: Your folder structure is saved and maintained across sessions

## Tips for Better Organization

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Create clear, memorable names for your folders
2. **Logical Grouping**: Organize contacts by purpose or relationship
3. **Regular Maintenance**: Keep your folders updated and organized
4. **Consistent Naming**: Use similar naming conventions across folders
5. **Limit Folder Size**: Don't let any single folder become too large - consider creating subcategories

The folder-based system makes managing your Starknet contacts intuitive and organized, helping you maintain a clean and
efficient address book for all your blockchain interactions.
