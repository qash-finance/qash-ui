# Group Payment

Q3x's group payment feature allows you to create and manage payment groups for splitting bills, collecting payments, or
organizing shared expenses. You can create custom groups with specific members or use the "Quick Share" feature for
instant payment sharing.

## How It Works

Group payments work in two main ways:

1. **Custom Groups**: Create permanent groups with specific members for recurring payments
2. **Quick Share**: Instantly share payment requests with anyone using a link

## Creating and Managing Groups

### Creating a New Group

1. **Start Group Creation**

   - Click the "New group" button in the top-right corner
   - Enter a descriptive name for your group
   - Select members from your address book

2. **Adding Members**

   - Browse through your address book categories (tabs)
   - Check the boxes next to contacts you want to add
   - Selected members appear in a summary table
   - Click "Create group" to finalize

3. **Group Organization**
   - Groups are automatically organized by member count
   - Each group shows the total number of members
   - Groups appear as cards at the top of the interface

### Managing Existing Groups

- **View Groups**: See all your groups displayed as cards with member counts
- **Select Groups**: Click on a group card to activate it for payments
- **Edit Groups**: Click the edit icon on any group to modify members or name
- **Delete Groups**: Remove groups you no longer need

## Making Group Payments

### Setting Up a Payment

1. **Choose Your Group**

   - Select a group from the group cards at the top
   - Or use "Quick Share" for instant sharing
   - The selected group determines who receives payment requests

2. **Configure Payment Details**

   - Enter the total amount to be split
   - Select the token (QASH, ETH, etc.)
   - Choose how many people to split between
   - Set the amount per person

3. **Quick Share vs. Group Payments**
   - **Quick Share**: Generate a link to share with anyone
   - **Group Payments**: Send requests directly to group members

### Payment Request Process

1. **Generate Request**: Create the payment request with your selected parameters
2. **Share with Members**:
   - For groups: Requests are sent to all group members
   - For Quick Share: Share the generated link with recipients
3. **Track Status**: Monitor who has paid, who is pending, and who has denied

## Understanding Payment Status

### Member Status Tracking

Each group member shows their payment status:

- **ðŸŸ¢ Paid**: Member has completed the payment
- **ðŸŸ¡ Pending**: Member has received the request but hasn't paid yet
- **ðŸ”´ Denied**: Member has declined the payment request

### Status Display Rules

- **Named Contacts**: Show the contact name from your address book
- **Quick Share**: Show "-" until payment is made, then show the address
- **Unknown Addresses**: Display formatted addresses (shortened for readability)

## Quick Share Feature

### How Quick Share Works

- **Instant Sharing**: Generate payment links without creating permanent groups
- **Flexible Recipients**: Share with anyone, even if they're not in your address book
- **Temporary**: No need to manage group membership
- **Universal Access**: Anyone with the link can view and pay

### Using Quick Share

1. **Select Quick Share**: Choose "Quick Share" as your group
2. **Set Payment Details**: Configure amount, token, and number of recipients
3. **Generate Link**: Create a shareable payment link
4. **Share Link**: Send the link to your intended recipients
5. **Track Payments**: Monitor who has paid through the link

## Group Management Features

### Editing Groups

- **Modify Members**: Add or remove group members
- **Change Names**: Update group names as needed
- **Access Control**: Manage who can see and interact with the group

### Group Organization

- **Member Counts**: Each group displays the total number of members
- **Visual Cards**: Groups are represented as easy-to-identify cards
- **Selection State**: Clearly see which group is currently active
- **Quick Actions**: Edit and manage groups directly from the interface

## Best Practices

### Creating Effective Groups

1. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, memorable names for your groups
2. **Logical Organization**: Group members by purpose (family, work, projects)
3. **Member Management**: Regularly update group membership as needed
4. **Payment Tracking**: Monitor payment status to ensure timely collection

### Using Quick Share Effectively

1. **Clear Communication**: Explain the payment purpose when sharing links
2. **Reasonable Deadlines**: Set appropriate timeframes for payment completion
3. **Follow Up**: Remind recipients about pending payments
4. **Link Security**: Only share payment links with intended recipients

## Important Notes

- **Group Persistence**: Custom groups are saved and can be reused
- **Quick Share Links**: Are temporary and don't create permanent groups
- **Member Limits**: Groups can accommodate multiple members
- **Token Support**: Works with various tokens including QASH and ETH
- **Real-time Updates**: Payment status updates automatically
- **Address Validation**: All addresses are validated before group creation

Group payments in Q3x provide a powerful way to manage shared expenses and collect payments from multiple people,
whether through organized groups or instant sharing with Quick Share.
