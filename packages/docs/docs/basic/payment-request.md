# Payment Request

Q3x's payment request feature allows you to request payments from others and manage incoming payment requests. You can
create shareable request links, send payment requests to specific addresses, and track the status of all your payment
requests.

## How It Works

Payment requests work in two directions:

1. **Requesting Payments**: Create requests for others to pay you
2. **Receiving Requests**: Accept or deny payment requests from others

The system automatically tracks all requests and provides a comprehensive dashboard for management.

## Request Link Section

### Your Personal Request Link

At the top of the dashboard, you'll see your personal request link:

- **Unique URL**: A shareable link that anyone can use to request payments from you
- **Easy Sharing**: Copy the link with one click to share with others
- **Universal Access**: Anyone with this link can create payment requests for you

### Creating New Requests

1. **Click "New request"** to open the request creation modal
2. **Set Request Details**:
   - Recipient address (who you want to request from)
   - Amount to request
   - Token type (QASH, ETH, etc.)
   - Message explaining the request
3. **Send Request** to the recipient

## Pending Payment Requests

### Incoming Requests

This section shows payment requests others have sent to you:

- **Amount**: Token amount and type being requested
- **Message**: Description or reason for the request
- **Request From**: Sender's address (with group payment indicator if applicable)
- **Date/Time**: When the request was created
- **Actions**: Accept or deny the request

### Managing Incoming Requests

#### Accepting Requests

1. **Review Details**: Check the amount, token, and message
2. **Click "Accept"**: Opens the send modal with pre-filled details
3. **Confirm Payment**: Review and confirm the transaction
4. **Complete Payment**: Send the requested amount to the requester

#### Denying Requests

1. **Click "Deny"**: Immediately rejects the request
2. **No Payment**: No tokens are sent, request is marked as denied
3. **Clean Slate**: Request is removed from your pending list

### Request Status Indicators

- **Pending**: New requests awaiting your response
- **Group Payment**: Requests from group payment systems (shown with group icon)
- **Pulse Animation**: Active requests may show visual indicators

## Accepted Payment Requests

### Completed Requests

This section tracks requests you've accepted and completed:

- **Amount**: Final amount and token that was sent
- **Message**: Original request message
- **Request From**: Who originally requested the payment
- **Date/Time**: When the request was created
- **Status**: Success or failure of the payment
- **Transaction Link**: View the transaction on the blockchain explorer

### Status Tracking

- **Succeed**: Payment was successfully completed
- **Failed**: Payment transaction failed (can retry if needed)

## Request Management Features

### Visual Organization

- **Table Format**: Clean, organized display of all requests
- **Token Icons**: Visual indicators for different token types
- **Address Truncation**: Shortened addresses for better readability
- **Group Indicators**: Special icons for group payment requests

### Filtering and Sorting

- **Pending vs. Accepted**: Separate sections for different request states
- **Chronological Order**: Requests sorted by creation date
- **Status-based Display**: Different information shown based on request status

## Creating Payment Requests

### Request Creation Process

1. **Access Creation Modal**: Click "New request" button
2. **Fill Request Details**:
   - **Recipient**: Enter the address you want to request from
   - **Amount**: Specify the amount you need
   - **Token**: Choose the token type
   - **Message**: Explain why you need the payment
3. **Send Request**: Submit to the recipient

### Request Types

- **Individual Requests**: Send to specific addresses
- **Group Payment Requests**: Part of group payment systems
- **Link-based Requests**: Anyone with your request link can create requests

## Best Practices

### Creating Effective Requests

1. **Clear Messages**: Explain why you need the payment
2. **Reasonable Amounts**: Request amounts that make sense
3. **Appropriate Timing**: Don't spam multiple requests
4. **Professional Communication**: Be polite and specific

### Managing Incoming Requests

1. **Quick Response**: Respond to requests promptly
2. **Verify Details**: Double-check amounts and addresses
3. **Consider Context**: Understand why someone is requesting payment
4. **Maintain Records**: Keep track of accepted/denied requests

### Security Considerations

1. **Verify Recipients**: Ensure request links go to intended people
2. **Monitor Activity**: Regularly check your request dashboard
3. **Avoid Public Sharing**: Don't post request links publicly
4. **Review Requests**: Carefully consider before accepting payments

## Important Notes

### Request Lifecycle

- **Created**: Request is sent to recipient
- **Pending**: Awaiting recipient response
- **Accepted**: Recipient agrees to pay
- **Completed**: Payment is successfully sent
- **Denied**: Recipient rejects the request

### Technical Details

- **Real-time Updates**: Request status updates automatically
- **Blockchain Integration**: All payments are recorded on-chain
- **Token Support**: Works with various tokens including QASH and ETH
- **Address Validation**: All addresses are validated before processing

### Limitations

- **One-time Use**: Each request can only be accepted or denied once
- **No Modifications**: Request details cannot be changed after creation
- **Recipient Requirements**: Recipients need compatible wallets
- **Network Dependencies**: Subject to blockchain network conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Request Not Showing**: Refresh the dashboard to see latest updates
- **Payment Failed**: Check your wallet balance and network status
- **Link Not Working**: Verify the request link is correct and active
- **Status Not Updating**: Wait for blockchain confirmation

### Getting Help

- Check your wallet connection status
- Verify you have sufficient token balance
- Ensure request details are correct
- Contact support if technical issues persist

Payment requests in Q3x provide a powerful way to request and manage payments from others, with a comprehensive
dashboard that keeps track of all your payment request activities.
