# What is Qash

[Qash](https://qash.finance) is an end-to-end private global payroll solution with flexible payment solutions like batch payment, recurring payment and milestone based payment. The platform addresses critical pain points in current blockchain payments where every transaction is publicly transparent, exposing salaries, vendor payments, and spending habits to the world.

The "end-to-end" has dual meaning: seamlessly bridging fiat-to-crypto conversions and covering the complete payment lifecycle from sending to receiving. For example, a Singapore company can pay a freelancer by sending SGD. On the receiving side, the receiver and choose to receive in stablecoin, fiat or any token and can customize receive logic by split salary payments, for example: 50% to on-chain savings and 50% for bank off-ramping.

## Why Qash?

### Private everywhere

Qash preserves privacy without sacrificing compliance. Using zkKYC and zkKYB, transactions remain compliant while hiding sensitive details, no on-chain exposure of balances, senders, or receivers.

Payroll is team-based, thus Qash also supports private multisig: signers, balances, transactions, recipients, and amounts are all hidden. Your company wallet stays secure—without leaking information to the public.

### Flexible payroll solution

Qash adapts to every payment need. We support recurring payments, batch payments, bonus payments, and milestone-based payments. Whether it’s fixed payroll or project-based work, Qash gives teams full flexibility in how they pay.

### Receiver-first payroll

Unlike traditional payroll tools that stop at sending funds, Qash is built for how people actually want to receive. Employees and contractors can define receive logic—split income across on-chain savings, off-ramping to bank, or forwarding to other accounts.

### AI Payroll Copilot

Qash comes with an AI-powered copilot that learns your team’s spending patterns to keep payroll safe. It detects anomalies, flags suspicious activity, and prevents mistakes or fraud before they happen and tell you why, giving you peace of mind with every payment.

### Programmable Payment Logic

Qash supports cancellable payments, time-locked transfers, “swap-and-pay,” and other custom logic so teams can tailor payroll to fit any agreement or condition.
