## 1. Private, Cross-Border Recurring Payroll with Customizable Income

An American startup needs to pay a developer in Vietnam every month.

From the company’s side, they only set:

- Payment amount (e.g., 3,000 USDT)
- Recipient address
- Recurring schedule (monthly)

Here’s how the process works:

1. Send USDT privately without exposing balances, sender, or recipient on-chain.
2. Deliver payments on schedule with no manual intervention, and stop automatically if suspicious activity is flagged.
3. Allow the receiver to customize income flow, for example:
   - 50% automatically off-ramped to VND for living expenses
   - 30% private cross-chain send to Arbitrum account to operate there
   - 20% allocated into a DeFi earning strategy

## 2. Private Multisig with Milestone-Based Grants Payments

The foundation wants to fund a developer team through a grant but only release funds once milestones are completed.

From the foundation side, they set:

- Total grant amount (e.g., 50,000 USDT)
- Milestone conditions (e.g., MVP launch, audit completed, mainnet deployment)

Here’s how the process works:

1. Funds are locked into a private multisig account, hiding signers, balances, and transactions.
2. When the team completes a milestone, multisig signers privately approve the release.
3. The developer team receives milestone payouts without exposing amounts or wallet details.
4. Unmet conditions mean funds remain securely locked, preventing misuse.
